Fix for ERESOLVE (React 19 vs Next 14):
- Pinned Next to ^14.2.33, React/ReactDOM to ^18.2.0
- Removed lockfiles (package-lock.json / yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml)
- Please run:
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
    npm run dev

If you still see peer conflicts, you may try:
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
(but this is not recommended unless necessary).
